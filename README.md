# Pandas-Matplotlib
This project introduces the basic concepts of two important libaries: Pandas and Matplotlib.
Pandas is used for manipulate the data, almost same as SQL but powerful with python in datascience.
while matplotlib is used for data visualization. Altough there are many data visualization tools such as Tableau and Qlikview, matplotlib is the best one integrated with python and pandas.
